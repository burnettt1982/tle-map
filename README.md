**Know Before You Own: Title Land Edification™ Interactive Map**

This map shows the power of transparent, citizen-driven public records verification. Any homebuyer, owner, or advocate can request official land records from local government agencies using TLE’s tools. There is never a charge for generating or filing a request. TLE’s team (and software) analyze the returned records for irregularities—such as title fraud, PIN tampering, or government record mismatches.

**You pay TLE only if we find and document a problem.**

**- All government fees are paid directly to government agencies.**

**- TLE does not act as a title insurer or agent.**

**- If your record is clear, your request is free.**

**Our mission:** Restore trust, justice, and certainty to property records—serving every homeowner and every future generation.

**Patent Notice:** Title Land Edification’s systems, including this map and backend, are protected by U.S. Patent Application No. 19/094,211 (filed March 28, 2025).
